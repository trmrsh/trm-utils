utility classes
===============

This package bundles up often useful stuff which has no other clear
home. It has sub-packages to do with 3D vectors (vec3), command line
argument handling (cline), and a few utility functions. It is often
needed in others of my packages.

Usual installation:

   pip install .

Add "--user" for a local install.
