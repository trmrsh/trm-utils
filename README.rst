utility classes
===============

This package bundles up often useful stuff which has no other clear
home. It has a sub-package to handle 3D vectors (vec3) and a few useful
functions, e.g. for measuring the positions of peaks in 1D arrays, and
fitting splines with rejection.

Usual installation:

   pip install .

Add "--user" for a local install.
